Social stratification is a kind of social differentiation whereby a society groups people into socioeconomic strata, based upon their occupation and income, wealth and social status, or derived power (social and political). As such, stratification is the relative social position of persons within a social group, category, geographic region, or social unit. In modern Western societies, stratification typically is distinguished as three social classes: the upper class, the middle class, and the lower class. Each class can be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g., occupational). Social stratification arises from social processes and relationships. It is maintained by ideologies that justify the unequal distribution of wealth and power. In addition to economic and occupational factors, stratification can also be based on caste, ethnicity, gender, age, and race.
