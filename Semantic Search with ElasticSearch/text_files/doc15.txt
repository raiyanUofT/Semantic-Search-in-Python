In computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are a cornerstone of computer science and are used for data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks. An algorithm's performance can be analyzed in terms of time complexity and space complexity. Time complexity describes the amount of time it takes to complete a task, while space complexity describes the amount of memory used during the task. Famous algorithms include sorting algorithms like quicksort and mergesort, search algorithms like binary search, and graph algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Algorithms can be expressed in various forms such as natural languages, pseudocode, flowcharts, and programming languages. Understanding and designing efficient algorithms is critical for developing effective software and systems.
