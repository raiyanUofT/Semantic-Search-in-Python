deforestation, and industrial processes. Climate change has led to many impacts on the environment and human systems. These include rising sea levels due to melting glaciers and polar ice sheets, more frequent and severe weather events like hurricanes and droughts, and disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity. Efforts to combat climate change include transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and reforestation. International agreements like the Paris Agreement aim to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration to limit it to 1.5 degrees.
