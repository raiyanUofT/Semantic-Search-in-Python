The solar system is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets, with the remainder being smaller objects such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. The solar system formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter. The four inner system planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are terrestrial planets, being composed primarily of rock and metal. The four outer system planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants, composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; Uranus and Neptune are ice giants, composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium.
