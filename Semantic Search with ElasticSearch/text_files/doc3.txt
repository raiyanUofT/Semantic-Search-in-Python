Newton's laws of motion are three physical laws that together laid the foundation for classical mechanics. They describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and its motion in response to those forces. The first law states that a body at rest will remain at rest, and a body in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by an external force. The second law quantifies the effect of forces on the motion of a body. It states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. The third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. These laws describe the motion of massive bodies and how they interact with each other. They are expressed mathematically and have been proven to be universal.
