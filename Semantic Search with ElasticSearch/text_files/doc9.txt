The law of supply and demand is one of the most fundamental concepts in economics and it is the backbone of a market economy. Supply refers to the quantity of a product or service that the market can offer, while demand refers to the quantity of a product or service that is desired by buyers. The price of a good or service is determined by the interaction of supply and demand in a market. When demand for a good increases and supply remains unchanged, a shortage occurs, leading to a higher equilibrium price. Conversely, when the supply of a good increases and demand remains unchanged, a surplus occurs, leading to a lower equilibrium price. Factors that affect demand include the price of the good, income levels, and consumer preferences, while factors affecting supply include production costs, technological innovations, and the number of sellers.
