The human heart is a muscular organ about the size of a closed fist that functions as the body's circulatory pump. It takes in deoxygenated blood through the veins and delivers it to the lungs for oxygenation before pumping it into various arteries, which supply oxygen and nutrients to the body tissues by way of the circulatory system. The heart's structure includes four chambers: two atria (upper chambers) and two ventricles (lower chambers). The right side of the heart receives deoxygenated blood and pumps it to the lungs, while the left side receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it to the rest of the body. The heart valves, which prevent the backflow of blood, are crucial for its function. The heart's rhythmic contractions are regulated by electrical impulses that originate from the sinoatrial node. Cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease, are major health issues affecting the heart.
