Impressionism was a 19th-century art movement characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of movement as a crucial element of human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles. The name of the movement is derived from Claude Monet's work, "Impression, soleil levant" ("Impression, Sunrise"). Impressionism originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s. The most conspicuous aspect of Impressionism was an attempt to capture the changing effects of light and color. Artists often painted "en plein air" (outdoors) to capture the momentary and transient effects of sunlight.
