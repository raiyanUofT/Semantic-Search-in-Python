Ethics, or moral philosophy, is a branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior. The field of ethics, along with aesthetics, concerns matters of value, and thus comprises the branch of philosophy called axiology. Ethics seeks to resolve questions of human morality by defining concepts such as good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and vice, justice and crime. As a field of intellectual inquiry, moral philosophy also is related to the fields of moral psychology, descriptive ethics, and value theory. Ethical theories are often divided into three general subject areas: meta-ethics, which investigates where our ethical principles come from and what they mean; normative ethics, which concerns the practical means of determining a moral course of action; and applied ethics, which concerns what a person is obligated (or permitted) to do in a specific situation or a particular domain of action.
