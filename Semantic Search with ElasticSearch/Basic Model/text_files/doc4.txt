Calculus, originally called infinitesimal calculus or "the calculus of infinitesimals", is the mathematical study of continuous change. It has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus. Differential calculus concerns instantaneous rates of change and the slopes of curves, while integral calculus concerns accumulation of quantities and the areas under and between curves. The two branches are related by the fundamental theorem of calculus, which states that differentiation is the reverse process to integration. Calculus has widespread applications in science, engineering, and economics and can solve many problems that algebra alone cannot. For example, calculus can be used to determine the most efficient way to transport goods, model population growth, and even determine the rate at which radioactive decay occurs.
