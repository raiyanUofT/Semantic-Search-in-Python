Democracy is a system of government in which the citizens exercise power directly or elect representatives from among themselves to form a governing body, such as a parliament. Democracy is sometimes referred to as "rule of the majority". The key elements of democracy include political freedom, rule of law, and civic participation. Different forms of democracy include direct democracy, where citizens directly deliberate and decide on legislation, and representative democracy, where citizens elect representatives to deliberate and decide on legislation, such as in parliamentary or presidential democracies. Democratic governance is characterized by fair, free, and competitive elections, protection of human rights, and the rule of law. Modern democracies also ensure protection of individual rights and freedoms and the opportunity for civic engagement and participation.
