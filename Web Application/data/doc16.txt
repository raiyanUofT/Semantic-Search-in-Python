Structural engineering is a sub-discipline of civil engineering in which structural engineers are trained to design the 'bones and muscles' that create the form and shape of man-made structures. Structural engineers need to understand and calculate the stability, strength, and rigidity of built structures for buildings and non-building structures. The structural designs are integrated with those of other designers such as architects and building services engineers and often supervise the construction of projects by contractors on site. They can also be involved in the design of machinery, medical equipment, and vehicles where structural integrity affects functioning and safety. Structural engineering theory is based upon applied physical laws and empirical knowledge of the structural performance of different materials and geometries. Structural engineers ensure their designs satisfy given design criteria, predicated on safety (e.g., structures must not collapse without due warning) and performance (e.g., building sway must not cause discomfort to the occupants).
