The Renaissance was a fervent period of European cultural, artistic, political, and economic "rebirth" following the Middle Ages. Generally described as taking place from the 14th century to the 17th century, the Renaissance promoted the rediscovery of classical philosophy, literature, and art. Some of the greatest thinkers, authors, statesmen, scientists, and artists in human history thrived during this era, while global exploration opened up new lands and cultures to European commerce. The Renaissance is credited with bridging the gap between the Middle Ages and modern-day civilization. It occurred after the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages and was associated with great social change. Some major developments of the Renaissance include the invention of the printing press, the development of perspective in painting, and advances in science.
