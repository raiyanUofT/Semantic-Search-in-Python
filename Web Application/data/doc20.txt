Language acquisition is the process by which humans acquire the capacity to perceive and comprehend language, as well as to produce and use words and sentences to communicate. For many years, the acquisition of language has been a topic of intense debate in linguistics and cognitive science. Researchers who study the way humans acquire language, especially during childhood, are interested in understanding the mental processes and mechanisms that underlie the ability to learn a language. There are several theories of language acquisition, including the nativist theory proposed by Noam Chomsky, which suggests that humans are born with an innate ability for language learning, and the social interactionist theory, which emphasizes the role of social interaction and communication in language learning. The study of language acquisition has implications for understanding developmental psychology, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence.
