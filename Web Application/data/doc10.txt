Cognitive development is a field of study in neuroscience and psychology focusing on a child's development in terms of information processing, conceptual resources, perceptual skill, language learning, and other aspects of brain development and cognitive psychology. A major theory of cognitive development is Jean Piaget's theory, which divides cognitive development into four stages: the sensorimotor stage, the preoperational stage, the concrete operational stage, and the formal operational stage. Each stage represents a different way of thinking and understanding the world. Cognitive development involves changes in cognitive process and abilities. Areas of cognitive development include information processing, intelligence, reasoning, language development, and memory. Research in this area also examines how factors such as culture, social environment, and education influence cognitive development.
