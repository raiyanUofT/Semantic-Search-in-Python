An ecosystem consists of all the living organisms in a particular area, along with the nonliving components of the environment with which the organisms interact, such as air, soil, water, and sunlight. Ecosystems can be of various sizes and can be marine, aquatic, or terrestrial. The biotic components of an ecosystem include plants, animals, and microorganisms, while the abiotic components include climate, soil, water, and sunlight. Ecosystems function through nutrient cycles and energy flows. The energy for ecosystems usually comes from the sun, via photosynthesis by primary producers (plants). This energy is then transferred to primary consumers (herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivores), and so on. Human activities such as deforestation, pollution, and climate change have significant impacts on ecosystems, leading to biodiversity loss and degradation of natural habitats.
